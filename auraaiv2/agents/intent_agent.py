### CRITICAL DISTINCTIONS:
- "take a screenshot" = screen_capture (NOT application_launch!)
- "what time is it" = system_query (NOT information_query - needs system clock)
- "focus notepad" = application_control (NOT application_launch - window exists)
- "open google.com" = browser_control (NOT application_launch - it's navigation)

### INTENT COLLISION RULE (MANDATORY):
Window geometry, focus, snapping, minimizing, maximizing, closing, switching, task view, virtual desktops
→ ALWAYS window_management, NEVER application_control.

Examples that MUST be window_management:
- "snap left/right" → window_management
- "minimize all" → window_management
- "switch window" → window_management
- "maximize this" → window_management
- "move to desktop 2" → window_management
- "close this window" → window_management (NOT application_control)
